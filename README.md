# SLIPSTREAM-AN AUTOMATED ELT PIPELINE FOR CUSTOMER'S VOICE AND DATA PLANS USING TERADATA BTEQ AND TPT UTILITIES

This repository contains the code and resources for the Slipstream project, which involves Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) operations on a dataset containing both voice and data plans. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust data model, perform data loading into Teradata tables, execute transformations to address data issues, and ultimately visualize the data using Tableau.

**Data Model**

The data model below shows the architecture of the slipsteam ELT project we performed here.
